# 🧠 AI-Powered Interview Helper

A smart web-based platform that automates technical interviews using Generative AI, intelligent resume parsing, timed question flows, and structured candidate evaluation — designed to mirror real-world technical screening.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is an **end-to-end interview automation system** built to reduce manual screening effort.
It conducts structured technical interviews by generating questions, evaluating responses, and presenting insights through a clean interviewer dashboard.

The core focus is **reliability, usability, and real interview logic**, not just AI output.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### 👤 Candidate Side

* Resume upload with automatic parsing (PDF / DOCX)
* Guided interview flow with clear instructions
* AI-driven technical questions with increasing difficulty
* Question timers with automatic submission
* Instant answer evaluation and feedback
* Interview progress saved automatically (refresh-safe)

---

### 🧑‍💼 Interviewer Side

* Centralized view of all candidates
* Access to complete interview transcripts
* Per-question and overall scoring
* Visual performance indicators
* AI-generated candidate summary

---

## 🧩 How the System Works

### 1️⃣ Resume Processing

* Detects file format
* Extracts text content
* Identifies basic candidate details
* Converts raw data into structured form

### 2️⃣ Question Generation

* Questions are generated dynamically
* Difficulty levels are enforced
* Duplicate questions are avoided
* Output is short, clear, and interview-appropriate

### 3️⃣ Answer Evaluation

* Technical relevance analysis
* Keyword and concept detection
* Clarity and completeness scoring
* Short, meaningful feedback

### 4️⃣ Fail-Safe Design

If AI services are unavailable:

* Rule-based evaluation is triggered
* Predefined questions are used
* Interview flow continues without interruption

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

This project follows a **fallback-first design**, ensuring the app never breaks:

* **Primary Layer**: Generative AI logic
* **Secondary Layer**: Algorithmic evaluation
* **Final Layer**: Curated interview content

This makes the platform usable even under API limits or network issues.
